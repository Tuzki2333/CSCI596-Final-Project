# CSCI596-Final-Project

## Problem Description

The knapsack problem is a well-known problem described as follows:

**Input**: a set of $n$ items with weights $w_1, w_2, \cdots, w_n$ and values $v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_n$; the space limit $W$
**Output**: a subset of items
**Constraint**: the total weight of chosen items is less than or equal to the space limit
**Objective**: maximize the total value of chosen items

In this project, I plan to solve the very-large-scale knapsack problem. That is, $n$ is very large.

## Challenges

The knapsack problem is known as NP-hard. Some existing algorithms include:

* Dynamic programming - Exact algorithm, pesudo-polynomial time $O(nW)$

* Branch-and-bound - Exact algorithm, exponential time $O(2^n)$

* Greedy algorithm - Approximate algorithm, require sorting, $O(n \log n)$
